# Newpipe Playlist Extractor
This small bash script extracts your offline playlists from [Newpipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe "Newpipe Github Page") databases.

When given a database, it will open files with the names of your Newpipe playlists, containing video urls and names.

# Usage
`playlistExtractor.sh [-o] File`

"File" is the exported zip from the app.

With the -o flag, files will be overwritten if they already exist.

# Requirements
This scirpt requires `sqlite3` and `unzip`.

Both of them can be installed by using the following command on Debian based distros:

```
sudo apt install unzip sqlite3
```

# Why?
Because Newpipe doesn't let you download your offline playlists.

You can feed the file generated by this script to `yt-dlp` with the `-a` flag.

You can, for example, use the following command to download all of the URLs in the file. 

`yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 -a playlist.txt`
